/*Greetings: Start with the array you used in Exercise 11, but instead of 
just printing each person’s name, print a message to them. The text of each
message should be the same, but each message should be personalized with 
the person’s name.*/

//Store the names in array
let title1 = ["Ahmad", "Mohad", "Faran"];
//printing names & msgs 1 by 1
for (let i = 0; i < title1.length; i++) {
alert("Welcome to metaverse, " + title1[i]);
}
